# Example 01: Basic Setup

## What This Example Demonstrates

This example shows the minimal setup for an AI Agent Ecosystem - just an `AGENTS.md` file. This is the foundation that every AI-assisted project should have.

## Files Included

- `AGENTS.md` - Core documentation for AI agents

## How to Use

1. Copy `AGENTS.md` to the root of your project
2. Customize it with your project's specifics:
   - Update project overview
   - Add your tech stack
   - Define your coding standards
   - List common commands
3. Commit it to your repository
4. AI agents (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) will automatically use it as context

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure basic AI agent documentation
- Essential sections every AGENTS.md should have
- How to communicate project conventions to AI
- The foundation for more advanced setups

## Next Steps

- See [Example 02](../02-with-ruler/) to add Ruler for automated consistency
- See [Example 03](../03-with-skills/) for the complete ecosystem with reusable Skills
- Read the [main README](../../README.md) for comprehensive documentation
